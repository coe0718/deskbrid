# deskbrid

**Whether a shell script or an AI agent is on the other end, the socket doesn't care.**

A single daemon that wraps Wayland protocols, DBus APIs, and PipeWire into a JSON-over-Unix-socket protocol. One binary. Zero config. Both your shell scripts and your AI agents use the same socket.

```bash
# A shell script using it
deskbrid action clipboard:read | grep "TODO" | notify-send

# An AI agent using it (same socket, same protocol)
→ {"action": "inject:type", "params": {"text": "git push origin main\n"}}
← {"type": "event", "event": "clipboard", "data": {"text": "git push origin main"}}
```

## Why now

Every major AI lab is racing to ship desktop agents — OpenAI Operator, Claude Code, Codex — and Linux is the gap nobody has solved cleanly. AppleScript gives macOS agents native control. Windows has UI Automation. Linux has... `xdotool` that breaks on Wayland.

Deskbrid is the missing abstraction layer, built at exactly the moment it's needed. It doesn't bet on agents taking off — automation use cases validate it today, agents validate it tomorrow. Same daemon, same protocol, same socket.

## One-minute demo

```bash
cargo run daemon &
deskbrid info                         # see what's available
deskbrid subscribe window:focus       # watch what you click
deskbrid action screenshot            # take the screenshot
deskbrid action clipboard:read        # grab what's copied
```

Or run `bash demo.sh` for a full walkthrough.

## Why

macOS agents walk on water — AppleScript, Accessibility APIs, a platform that doesn't fight back. Linux agents have `xdotool` that breaks on Wayland and a pile of different DBus APIs with different conventions.

Every agent platform on Linux has the same problem. Deskbrid is the **one thing to install** that solves it for all of them.

## Install

```bash
# From source
cargo install deskbrid
deskbrid daemon

# Or from the repo
git clone https://github.com/coe0718/deskbrid
cd deskbrid
cargo run daemon

# Python client (optional — agents use this)
pip install ./clients/python/
```

Systemd user service:
```bash
cp deploy/deskbrid.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user enable --now deskbrid
```

## Prerequisites

```bash
sudo apt install wl-clipboard grim    # clipboard + screenshots
```

| `clipboard:write` | Write to clipboard |
| subscribe `clipboard` | Watch for clipboard changes |

### 📸 Screen capture
| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| `screenshot` | Capture the screen (gnome-screenshot or grim) |
| `screencast:start/stop` | Stream screen via PipeWire *(Phase 2)* |

### 🔔 Notifications
| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| `notification:send` | Send a desktop notification |
| subscribe `notifications` | Watch incoming notifications |

### 📺 Display
| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| `display:list` | List monitors (resolution, scale, refresh rate) |

### 🎵 Audio *(planned)*
| subscribe `audio:node` | Watch audio device state changes |

## Client libraries

| Language | Status | Install |
|---|---|---|
| **Python** | ✅ **Done** | `pip install ./clients/python/` |
| **Rust** (built-in CLI) | ✅ **Done** | `cargo install deskbrid` |

# Subscribe to events
@client.on("window:focus")
def on_focus(w):
    print(f"Focused: {w.app_id} — {w.title}")

# Actions
client.type_text("deploy production\n")
keys = client.send_keys(["ctrl", "shift", "t"])
text = client.clipboard_read().text
path = client.screenshot()

client.listen()  # blocks, streaming events
```

## Supported desktops

| Desktop | Session | Status |
|---|---|---|
| GNOME 42+ | Wayland | ✅ Tested |
| GNOME 40+ | Wayland | ⚠️ Should work |
| KDE Plasma | Wayland | 🔄 Planned |
| Sway / wlroots | Wayland | 🔄 Planned |
| X11 | X11 | ❌ Not planned |

## Why standalone

Deskbrid is **not** tied to any agent platform. It's a Unix daemon with a documented protocol, like `pipewire` or `systemd`. Any agent — Hermes, Praxis, Claude Code, OpenAI Operator — implements the 15-line client and gets full desktop control.

> "But I can just call DBus from my agent."
>
> You could learn GNOME Shell's Eval API, Mutter's RemoteDesktop session lifecycle, PipeWire's stream negotiation, the notification spec, and GVariant parsing. Or you install one binary and send JSON.

```python
# The "agent platform integration" — this is it
from deskbrid import Deskbrid
client = Deskbrid()
client.type_text("git push\n")
```
